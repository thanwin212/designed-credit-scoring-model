# Project: Designed Credit Scoring Model (2020)

## Overview
I was the co-designer of the credit scoring model and responsible for overall project management. This project involved building an in-house credit scoring engine that enabled the detection of potential customers likely to default, streamlining the loan approval process based on collected application data and customer credit scoring factors.

## Key Achievements
- **Risk Assessment**: The system effectively assessed the creditworthiness of potential borrowers using different market segmentation data related to customers' profiles through statistical analysis.
- **Efficient Decision Making**: The credit committee found the model to be a valuable tool, significantly reducing the time required to review and approve loan applications.
- **Consistent Scoring**: The scoring model provided a fair and consistent measure of creditworthiness, free from personal bias.
- **Fraud Detection**: The model played a vital role in detecting fraudulent loan applications by analyzing inconsistent data in borrowers' applications and using statistical algorithms.

## Technologies and Tools Used
- Presentation
- Trello
- Excel
- R

## Challenges Faced
- **Lack of Knowledge in Statistical Analysis**: Statistical analysis and programming language R were new to me at the time. I had to quickly learn and execute the project in collaboration with the lead designer for USAID.
- **Inconsistent Data**: Inconsistent data from the past could potentially mislead the model in interpreting data for scoring measures. We developed a solution to detect mismatched data in the core banking system by collecting applications directly through tablets used by loan officers.
- **Validation and Evaluation**: Historical data was used to continuously test and update the scoring model based on the resulting scoring measures.

This project exemplified my expertise in the areas of statistical analysis, mathematics, R language, advanced data analytics, and the foundation of machine learning. It also sparked my interest in further exploring data analytics.
